	<div itemprop="articleBody" class="article-body"><p>The Open-Source Machine Learning Masters (OSMLM) is a self-curated deep-dive into select topics in machine learning and distributed computing. Educational resources are derived from online courses (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOCs</a>), textbooks, predictive modeling competitions, academic research (<a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>), and the open-source software community. In machine learning, both the quantity and quality of these resources - all available for free or at a trivial cost - is truly f*cking amazing.</p>
<h2>Why Am I Doing This?</h2>
<p>I want to become more of a technical expert in machine learning. I want to use this expertise to solve real-world problems that actually matter (moving the field forward on purely theoretical grounds is less interesting to me).</p>
<p>To this end, I see two main roads: a traditional graduate program, and the OSMLM.</p>
<h3>Why Not Graduate School</h3>
<p>For me, graduate school is suboptimal for 3 key reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It's expensive.</strong> Upon a quick Google search, a 2-year graduate program would cost, conservatively, $80,000 in tuition fees alone. This is a wholly nontrivial sum of money that would impact how I structure the next 10 years of my life.</li>
<li><strong>There are <em>far</em> more dependencies.</strong> I have to apply. I have to get accepted. I have to find the right professor. I have to find a city suitable to my broader interests and lifestyle. This takes time.</li>
<li><strong>By the time I finish, the field of machine learning will look fundamentally different than it did when I started.</strong> This is the most important point of all. The only way to remain current with the latest tools and techniques is to do just that. Given the furious and only-accelerating-faster pace at which machine learning is moving, this requires much more than just a few hours on the weekend.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Why the OSMLM</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>I think the higher education paradigm is changing.</strong> Access to critical, academic knowledge is increasingly democratic: <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> can teach me about the Central Limit Theorem as well as any statistics professor. The ~$250,000 in tuition fees commanded by an undergraduate education at a private American university is, for some, several decades of debt and concession, and for others, prohibitive beyond comedy, reason and fantasy alike. If hard-skills are your end, online self-education is an immensely attractive, intuitive, and practical road to follow - especially in an industry as meritocratic as tech.</li>
<li><strong>I'm keenly aware of how productive I am in a self-teaching environment.</strong> I'm largely self-taught in data science. Before that, it was online poker: a 5-year, $50 to $150,000 journey of instructional videos, online forums, critical discussion with other players and personal coaching - all from the comfort of my bedroom. I'm very effective at learning things online.</li>
<li><strong>Some of the most impactful projects I've completed professionally stemmed directly from those I'd completed personally.</strong> I would not know how to ensemble models if not for <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a>. I would not know how to perform hierarchical Bayesian inference if not for <a href="http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/">Bayesian Methods for Hackers</a>. The open-source data science community continues to teach me creative ways to use data to solve challenging problems. To this end, I want to consume, consume, consume.</li>
<li><strong>The road to further technical expertise is a function of little more than time and effort.</strong> I have a few years' industry experience as a Data Scientist. I can write clean code and productionize machine learning things. For me, the OSMLM is nothing more than taking all of the extra-curricular time spent learning new tools and algorithms and making it a full-time job.</li>
<li><strong>I'm extremely motivated.</strong> The thought of studying machine learning all day has me smiling from ear to ear. Simply put, I f*cking love this stuff.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How Long is the OSMLM?</h2>
<p>9-12 months. Not forever.</p>
<h2>Why Morocco?</h2>
<p>I aim to speak indistinguishably fluent French and Spanish by the time I'm 30. I'm currently 27. The Spanish box is largely <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqO0KW3O9uU">checked</a>. With 6-9 months in Francophone Morocco, the French box will be largely checked as well.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I've always wanted to live in a Muslim country: I grew up in a predominantly Jewish suburb of Philadelphia, and have had fantastic experiences traveling the Muslim world.</p>
<h2>How Will I Spend My Time?</h2>
<p>I'll be spending my best 8-10 hours of the day working from a co-working space. I'll be taking online courses, reading textbooks, participating in machine learning competitions and publishing open-source code. I intend to post frequently to this blog.</p>
<h2>What Will I Learn?</h2>
<p>I have 4 main areas of focus:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>"Deep Learning" with flavors of: auto-encoders, recommendation, and natural language processing.</strong> I remain obsessed with encoding real-world entities as lists of numbers. I like applications that seek to understand people better than they understand themselves. Free-form text is everywhere (and relatively quick to process).</li>
<li><strong>Bayesian Inference.</strong> Because they taught me frequentist statistics in school.</li>
<li><strong>Game Theory and Reinforcement Learning.</strong> I wrote an <a href="https://honors.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/1947">undergraduate thesis</a> in game theory and group dynamics and remain eager to tackle more. Reinforcement Learning seems like the hipster way to solve such problems these days.</li>
<li><strong>Apache Spark and Distributed Computing.</strong> I have a bit of professional experience with Spark. As data continues to grow in size, distributed computing will move from a thing Google does to a no-duh occupational necessity.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What Does Success Look Like?</h2>
<p>Success has a few faces:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Technical.</strong> Have the technical expertise to lead teams focused on each of the above 4 topics (weighted towards the former 3, realistically).</li>
<li><strong>Personal.</strong> Learning how I best learn. How do I structure my ideal working day? Do I prefer working alone, or indeed as part of a team? What is my optimal balance of reading, thinking, and coding?</li>
<li><strong>Language.</strong> I intend to speak French like it's my mother tongue.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What Happens Afterwards?</h2>
<p>I'm likely headed back to the Americas, where I intend to devote myself to an impossibly awesome technology project and team for a period of several years. I'd like a technical mentor as well.</p>
<h2>How Can You Help?</h2>
<p>In addition to self-study, I'd like to assist a few fascinating Moroccan technology organizations with their data problems. As such, if you know anyone in-country with even the most fleeting shared interest, please put me in touch.</p>
<h2>In Two Sentences</h2>
<p>The Open-Source Machine Learning Masters in Casablanca, Morocco allows me to pursue several significant personal goals at the same time. This is my Francophone machine learning adventure.</p></div>
