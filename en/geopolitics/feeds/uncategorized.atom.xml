This has been the historical focus of this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I've been reading heavily in other areas as well: history, political theory, strategy, economics and geography; geopolitics, in sum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The geopolitics of yesterday—the subject of my reading—has its experts and central themes: collective security, nuclear armament, and oil, to name a few. Conversely, the geopolitics of tomorrow will take form from entirely new ideas; chief among them: artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, I plan to merge the two: to suffuse, through writing, my exploration of the former with my expertise in the latter. &lt;strong&gt;Specifically, I'll connect deep, technical knowledge of AI algorithms, as well as the likely implications of their widespread use, to the risks—and opportunities—that AI will bring to the geopolitics of tomorrow.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My writing will be objective, i.e. devoid of overt political bias. My intended audience is non-technical, i.e. geopolitics-first. Your comments—especially with respect to my evolving understanding of geopolitics itself—are encouraged as always.&lt;/p&gt;
