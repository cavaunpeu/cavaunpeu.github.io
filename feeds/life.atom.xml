Motivation, logistics and strategic insight re: designing the "Open-Source Masters" for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As an "in" professional discipline, Machine Learning exhibits a curious behavior: though talent is frustratingly scarce, it's immensely &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; for the individual to obtain. Why? &lt;strong&gt;It's all available online, (largely) free for the taking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not get a bachelor's degree in this field. Self-teaching at my kitchen table in 2014, I landed a job as a software developer. Self-teaching still, I joined &lt;a href="https://www.shopkeep.com/"&gt;ShopKeep&lt;/a&gt;'s Data Science team. Eighteen months later and wanting further technical expertise, I quit my job, left NYC, and jumped full-time into machine learning self-study — the best, if only, way I knew how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September of 2016, I moved to Casablanca, Morocco to pursue the &lt;a href="https://cavaunpeu.github.io/2016/07/29/my-open-source-machine-learning-masters-in-casablanca-morocco/"&gt;"Open-Source Machine Learning Masters"&lt;/a&gt; — a full-time, self-curated schedule of textbooks, MOOCs, publishing code to my &lt;a href="https://github.com/cavaunpeu"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and writing to this blog. Now back living and working in NYC, &lt;a href="https://cavaunpeu.github.io/2017/09/09/joining-asapp/"&gt;decidedly successful&lt;/a&gt; in what I set out to do, I'd like to inform others as to how to plan and execute a similar program for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a practical guide to the "Open-Source Machine Learning Masters" (OSMLM). It is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a technical guide, which would provide concrete guidance on what to study. Instead, my aim is to provide motivation, logistical details, and strategic insight — to take you from "that seems cool, but crazy" to "woah, this is not only feasible, but really makes a lot of sense." I personally find the latter much more valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content is organized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why this might be right for you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building a curriculum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logistics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. Educational resources&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. Branding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. Workspace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. Where to live&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e. Costs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;f. Visas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;g. Community&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;h. Insurance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping a schedule&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A sense of urgency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal development objectives, in parallel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applying for the next job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why there's very little risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why this might be right for you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should pursue the OSMLM for the same reasons that you'd pursue a traditional master's program: because you want further technical expertise in this field. The motivation behind this ambition may vary: perhaps you've a bachelor's in Economics and want to break into data science, or perhaps you're dexterous with &lt;a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/"&gt;scikit-learn&lt;/a&gt;, are effective in your role, yet need to understand more deeply how your tools work in order to obtain a promotion. The OSMLM, like a formal master's, is a semi-broad deep-dive into select topics in machine learning and not much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OSMLM confers a number of obvious benefits in cost, expediency and flexibility. These are enumerated in detail in the &lt;a href="https://cavaunpeu.github.io/2016/07/29/my-open-source-machine-learning-masters-in-casablanca-morocco/"&gt;motivating post&lt;/a&gt;. Notwithstanding, what are the downsides? To this effect, what type of person is required to pull this off?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Downsides&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no one to push you but yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; A priori, there are no professors. There are no study groups. There will be no tangible social pressure: it will probably just be you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This might be viewed as a "radical" choice&lt;/strong&gt;. In ten years, I'm certain this will change. However, in 2018, you'll find few people with the line "Open-Source Masters" on their résumé.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The meritocracy comes to bear.&lt;/strong&gt; A master's degree from a prominent University, along with a passable GPA, holds professional weight (for better or for worse). In contrast, the OSMLM attacks on one singular vector: that &lt;em&gt;talent&lt;/em&gt; is weight, and that success in this program is developing this talent. There will be no "diploma-crutch."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who this is for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the above in order, the OSMLM might be right for you if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You're convicted about your passion for the field&lt;/strong&gt;. The thought of studying machine learning all day has you smiling from ear to ear. No one will push you but yourself, and that's the only person you need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don't mind being different.&lt;/strong&gt; You're not phased by the notion of explaining — crisply and with conviction — why you made the choice to pursue this program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You feel the meritocracy in your bones.&lt;/strong&gt; You're confident in your ability to master material, and communicate it back to others. You know what the bar is for employment in your desired role, you know that you'll surpass that bar after finishing this program, and you trust that &lt;em&gt;because the meritocracy is real, this program could do nothing but bear delicious, abundant fruit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Logistics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Educational resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I derived my educational resources from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MOOCs (massive open online courses)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Textbooks (often obtainable in electronic format)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blog posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDLKJtOVx5c&amp;amp;list=PLD0F06AA0D2E8FFBA"&gt;mathematicalmonk videos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree"&gt;Udacity "Nanodegrees"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/"&gt;Kaggle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours may be different. However, the promise is: &lt;strong&gt;all of these materials are available online, and for a trivial or zero cost.&lt;/strong&gt; If you've been in the field for more than a month, this is probably already clear to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Branding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, this is a radical choice! If only because you won't know many others doing the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In NYC, everyone is asked for their story — in interviews, at parties, on the subway. Preparing to quit my job, leave the city and move to Morocco — what was mine? How would I present this to others before leaving, during the experience, and after returning to the city? Believe it or not, I started composing, if mentally rehearsing, this story long before I ever left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Before&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be excited. "Here's what I'm doing! Here's why I'm doing it! I'm scared, yet convicted. It's awesome, and I will be back, more learned than ever. Promise."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;During&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain a blog.&lt;/strong&gt; This is an extremely important point of strategy. &lt;strong&gt;Arguably, this was my most crucial insight throughout this whole experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping a blog serves three principal ends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It helps you to concretize knowledge.&lt;/strong&gt; If you're going to share something with others, it is &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; to motivate yourself to make sure you know what you're talking about. This stems from the basic human tendencies of fearing both rejection, and the perception of inconsistency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It helps you to stay relevant in other people's eyes.&lt;/strong&gt; I was diligent about sharing my posts on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/willwolf_"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.datatau.com/"&gt;DataTau&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, they were shared by others. In fact, I received 7 blind interview requests from managers that had read my blog (and continue to receive them to this day). This is a point of expediency, not braggadocio: do it well once, share it, and reap the rewards for a long time to come.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It gives you something — nay, everything — to talk about in your interviews upon your return.&lt;/strong&gt; I was keenly aware of the importance, for better or for worse, of maintaining a public sharing space of personal projects before I left for Morocco. Throughout the OSMLM, I could cynically be characterized as a "professional blog-writer/portfolio-builder." &lt;strong&gt;Upon return, over half of my interviews began with: "Hey, I read that blog post which I really enjoyed. Mind walking me through it?" Uh, yep. No problem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to a blog, I found that &lt;strong&gt;maintaining a presence on Twitter proved valuable as well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The machine learning community is small: build yourself a community within,&lt;/strong&gt; for all the same reasons that community-building is more generally valuable to your work, and quality of life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People will likely find your idea enviable and admirable.&lt;/strong&gt; Everyone likes a "radical," and the idea of living in a "far-off land." In addition, if they're passionate about machine learning (and cognizant of the speed at which it moves), they probably relish the thought of full-time study as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;After&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See "Applying for the next job" below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Workspace&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lived in an apartment in Casablanca. However, I would not have been happy working out of this apartment as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all those with ambition to work and travel: co-working spaces are a thing. Even in Morocco. They have comparatively fast internet (to the median speed found in the city at large), desks, coffee, patios, food, and most importantly, other motivated individuals like yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your choice of workspace is up to you. For me, finding a space outside of my apartment in which to work was important for my social and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where to live&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is huge! And in most of the world, $1,000/month gets you pretty far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to live in Morocco so as to improve my French, and live in an Arab country more generally. Your interests are probably different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nomadlist.com/"&gt;NomadList&lt;/a&gt; is a terrific resource for choosing where to "digital nomad." It indexes countries based on things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost of living&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internet speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weather&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safety&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Female-friendliness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LGBTQ-friendliness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're unsure about where you might want to go, I would start here. &lt;strong&gt;In addition, moving abroad is of course in no way a requirement for this program&lt;/strong&gt;. However, the assumption is that you won't be generating income, so pursuing the OSMLM in your home country might prove expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Visas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, do not overlook visa requirements. Follow the rules. In Morocco, I was granted 3-month tourist visas, which I could renew by spending a few hours in neighboring Spain. For an in-depth look at visa regulations, please visit my personal favorite, &lt;a href="https://www.visahq.com/"&gt;VisaHQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Costs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, my costs had the following dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthly rent: $600/month&lt;/strong&gt; for a beautiful, central, sunlit, and furnished 2-bedroom apartment in the center of Casablanca, which I often split with a friend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coworking space: $300/month&lt;/strong&gt;. Really expensive, in my opinion! (I found the same in Mexico City as well, that a monthly co-working fee ran roughly half of what I'd pay in rent.) All the same, &lt;strong&gt;I only spent 2 months here before moving to friends' offices.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educational resources: roughly $1,100.&lt;/strong&gt; This said, I spent $800 on the first half of the &lt;a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889"&gt;Udacity Artifical Intelligence Nanodegree&lt;/a&gt; program. Thereafter, I bought a textbook, subscribed to some Coursera courses at $50/per, etc. &lt;strong&gt;Overall, if I wanted this cost to be $0, I could have made that happen.&lt;/strong&gt; In any event, I do find the aforementioned costs trivial considering the value I received in return, and even moreso as compared to tuition in a formal master's setting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 10 months, I spent roughly $12,000. I ate out, traveled some, and afforded a terrific quality of life built around the thing I wanted to do most: full days of bright-eyed, and well-rested, machine learning study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Community&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew 2 people in Casablanca before I arrived. Finding a community was important to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology/entrepreneurship communities can be found worldwide (&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrianavendano/"&gt;Adrian Avendano&lt;/a&gt; is an unbelievable testament to this fact). Casablanca was no different. I attended Meetups, pitch events, happy hours, and even &lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Casablanca/"&gt;PyData Casablanca&lt;/a&gt;! After a while, I was able to surround myself with people that kept me happy and helped me grow. Choosing to work from a co-working space can often give you this "for free" as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Insurance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like any extended international trip, ensure that you've premeditated your options in the event of theft, dental, or medical emergencies. This is standard practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the OSMLM, give special thought to &lt;em&gt;computer&lt;/em&gt; insurance as well: without your computer, there's not a whole lot of work that you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your computer breaks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where's the computer store?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will i get a new one?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How long will this take?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will vary by country. Investigate beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building a curriculum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know the landscape of machine learning educational resources exceedingly well, if only because the field is dear to my heart. I know what I know, and I know what textbooks, courses and papers I'm dying to have the time and energy to properly consume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the OSMLM was 10 months of navigating, with discipline yet flexibility, this dreamscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unfortunately, prescribing you a concrete academic curriculum is outside the scope of this post&lt;/strong&gt; for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone will have a different initial base of knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On some level, your "curriculum" should already be in motion: if "you’re convicted about your passion for the field" (as noted above), you probably already have some idea of what you'd like to learn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This said, if you're looking for resources on specific topics, I likely &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; a great person with whom to speak, and I'm more than happy to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keeping a schedule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like building a curriculum, this came easy to me: keeping a disciplined, focused schedule around machine-learning self-study was all I wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this comes less easily to you: &lt;strong&gt;treat this like a job.&lt;/strong&gt; Get rest. Take weekends off. Exercise before you go to work (if that's your thing). Leave your workspace at a reasonable hour, and pursue hobbies, relationships and culture at night. Hold yourself accountable. Do whatever worked for you in a previous job, or period of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A sense of urgency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a salaried job, you trade the myriad potential upsides of entrepreneurship for stability: assuming you do your job well, you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; receive a paycheck twice a month, (largely) irrespective of the exact hours you put in. "Hustling" bears few fruit. Ultimately, your goal is longevity: to continue to do great work, and be excited about this work; to not burn out; to be there in a few years' time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the OSMLM, things are different. Here, you've "ripped the carpet out from under you." You have no paycheck, no immediate professional support, no structural "crutch." Furthermore, once finished, you will have something to &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; to your previous professional world (in interviews, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My [machine learning] goal for the OSMLM was to learn as much as possible. My resource-bottleneck was time. As such, it became &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; to keep a robust schedule, and to work slightly-longer-than-normal hours. It was, stated &lt;em&gt;dramatically&lt;/em&gt;, "fight or flight." Looking back, I am impressed, though not entirely surprised, with how much work I produced within this context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the OSMLM, &lt;strong&gt;a sense of urgency is a feature, not a bug.&lt;/strong&gt; Use it to your advantage — as a biologically-principled infusion of raw motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Personal development objectives, in parallel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, in addition to further technical expertise in ML, I wanted to both ~perfect my French, and live in an Arab country. Pursuing the OSMLM in Casablanca allowed me to chase all three goals simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the technical, what are &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; goals? Is there a language you'd like to learn? A sport you'd like to try? A list of books you'd like to read?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no mandate to have a single focus: &lt;strong&gt;you're in control of your days.&lt;/strong&gt; If you want to study machine learning from Monday-Thursday, then write fantasy novels on Fridays, you should do that. If you'd like to teach English abroad, move into a school in Japan and study machine learning at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the OSMLM isn't about machine learning at all. Instead, it's about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing down your learning goals, and acknowledging that most of the knowledge they require is freely available online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figuring out the most expedient way of accomplishing these goals, ideally simultaneously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting after it, now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Applying for the next job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this might seem daunting, it is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; the easiest part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a narrative&lt;/strong&gt;. Clearly communicate why you chose to pursue this program, and why it was the best choice for you, personally. To almost any employer for whom I wanted to work, it was a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; easy case to make.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you kept a blog, things will come to you.&lt;/strong&gt; As noted above, I got many interviews from people having read my blog; furthermore, the majority of my remaining interviews were structured around a walk-through of a post I had written. This puts you in the driver's seat from the start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If it's clear that you worked hard, you really can't lose.&lt;/strong&gt; The OSMLM aligns cleanly with three key things a startup looks for in a prospective technical hire: a passion for your work, a demonstrated ability to learn quickly and autonomously, and a portfolio showcasing what you can actually do, today. If you worked hard throughout your OSMLM, you'll bring all three in spades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I returned from my &lt;a href="http://willtravellife.com/"&gt;two-year trip&lt;/a&gt;, and sat down to face my interviewer, that was all they wanted to discuss! It was seen as "different, courageous, enviable." Empirically, the OSMLM was received in largely the same manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, to the extent you've kept a blog, simply sharing with your readers that you're looking for "what's next" is a great way to get started. Fortunately, I had many fantastic individuals following my journey, and they were nothing but helpful in connecting me with their network when I began to plot next steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviewing upon return is the fun part. You'll be surprised how well this experience is received, and just how far it takes you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why there's really little risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assuming you put in the work,&lt;/em&gt; I see two possible outcomes for this experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You realize you don't like machine learning all that much.&lt;/strong&gt; If you're disenchanted with this field after dedicating a meager 6-12 months to its mastery, then it's probably not for you. &lt;strong&gt;Realizing this would be a win, not a loss.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You become a pseudo-expert in machine learning&lt;/strong&gt;. Perhaps with another spoken language under your belt, or having lived abroad for the first time. You're energized, refreshed, and ready to return to a job (or join the field itself). You have stories and a portfolio of work that raise other's eyes. &lt;strong&gt;In my view, this is at once your worst-case, and best-case, scenario.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, dedicating an extended period of time to one of the hottest professional fields of the present can only bring opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being an effective machine learning practitioner requires fluency in a large body of material. Fortunately, this material exists entirely online, largely for free, &lt;strong&gt;and is yours for the taking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the extent that you're an effective autodidact, the OSMLM is a cost-effective, flexible, and overall highly-expedient way in which to acquire this knowledge. It is not a sabbatical, but instead a &lt;em&gt;principled and strategic&lt;/em&gt; period of focused study. Furthermore, it allows you to pursue other pressing personal goals in parallel, and brings energy, new perspective, and a point of differentiation as you return to the working world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As i was told by a VP of Research during an interview: "it's clear from your work that you learned far more in this year than you would have in a traditional master's." Personally, I didn't know how to do it any other way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="life"></category></entry><entry><title>Joining ASAPP</title><link href="https://cavaunpeu.github.io/2017/09/09/joining-asapp/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-09-09T12:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-09-09T12:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Will Wolf</name></author><id>tag:cavaunpeu.github.io,2017-09-09:/2017/09/09/joining-asapp/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm joining &lt;a href="https://www.asapp.com/"&gt;ASAPP, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; as a Machine Learning Engineer.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The open-source &lt;a href="http://willwolf.io/2016/07/29/my-open-source-machine-learning-masters-in-casablanca-morocco/"&gt;"masters"&lt;/a&gt; has come to a close. I'm now joining &lt;a href="https://www.asapp.com/"&gt;ASAPP, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; as a Machine Learning Engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASAPP builds artificial-intelligence tools for enterprise. My work involves building backend infrastructure for machine-learning products — with a focus on NLP. We're rather stealth, so that's all I can say for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we are hiring — for Research Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist, Software Engineer, Automation Engineer, DevOps, iOS/Android Engineer, Security Engineer and Product Designer roles. If you'd like to work with a truly fantastic &lt;a href="https://www.asapp.com/team/"&gt;team&lt;/a&gt;, feel free to &lt;a href="mailto:will@asapp.com"&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;. We're on the 83rd floor of the World Trade Center as well — with a view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="view from world trade center" class="img-responsive" src="https://cavaunpeu.github.io/images/world_trade_center.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this next chapter of life, my primary professional and personal focuses will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep studying.&lt;/strong&gt; Bayesian probabilistic models and deep-learning-for-NLP, mostly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public speaking.&lt;/strong&gt; I'd like to continue speaking about machine learning and software engineering at conferences and Meetups — in the United States and abroad. (Con el segundo, me refiero principalmente a América Latina; contácteme si quiere colaborar!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight lifting.&lt;/strong&gt; I want to get some muscles. I feel like a stronger core, back and upper body will help with programmer-neck-aches as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My time in Morocco was extremely productive and rewarding. Now back in NYC, I'm beyond excited to stay put, and keep working. If you live here as well — and enjoy mathematics, data, language, cycling or food — let's try our best to meet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="life"></category></entry><entry><title>My Next Role</title><link href="https://cavaunpeu.github.io/2017/06/20/my-next-role/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-20T11:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-06-20T11:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Will Wolf</name></author><id>tag:cavaunpeu.github.io,2017-06-20:/2017/06/20/my-next-role/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Beginning the search for an impossibly awesome next role.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My nine-month open-source &lt;a href="https://cavaunpeu.github.io/2016/07/29/my-open-source-machine-learning-masters-in-casablanca-morocco/"&gt;"masters"&lt;/a&gt; in machine learning and statistics — a full-time, self-curated schedule of textbooks, MOOCs, publishing code to my &lt;a href="https://github.com/cavaunpeu"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and writing to this blog — is soon ending. I'm now starting my search for an impossibly awesome "what's next."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I bring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bring abundant experience in: &lt;strong&gt;machine learning, Bayesian statistics and probabilistic programming, backend engineering, visualization and making complex ideas easy to understand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, within your organization, I could immediately bring value to: ETL infrastructure, experimental design and execution, internal and external data products, i.e. algorithm design and deployment, and data evangelism efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I'm looking for&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Excellent, direct technical mentorship, and the opportunity to mentor others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A medium-to-large-sized company with a well-established data science team. Alternatively, a smaller company with machine learning at the core of its business that, necessarily, has made significant investments in data science infrastructure and personnel.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most of you, I spent the day of Donald Trump's election in a state of disbelief, paralysis and exasperation. Like many more, I had several long, critical conversations about what had just happened and where we go from here. In one conversation, a friend exclaimed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, admittedly, live in a bubble: I know no Trump supporters. You, Will, have a diverse group of friends: surely you know a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While my peers are very diverse in race, culture, gender and geography, I don't believe a single one voted for Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is now so grippingly clear, these people do exist, and in numbers! They are blue collar workers. They are white men and white women from Middle America. They are Latina females in Florida. They are tailgaters at Penn State football games. They are critical thinkers from Ohio. And I don't know a single one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="trump rally" class="img-responsive" src="https://cavaunpeu.github.io/images/trump_rally.jpeg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have spent our adult lives in swift, upward mobility. We went to strong Universities because we went to strong high schools. For many, our parents paid for our education, leaving us as debt-free graduates with little existential challenge beyond navigating the subway map. Thereafter, we moved to great cities and found great jobs. We traveled internationally. We learned to speak Russian, to play the viola, to build ceramic pots on the weekends and take pictures with a DSLR. Moreover, from birth, we were taught that education, self-diversification and intellectual curiosity were normal and cool. Simply, we were taught how to dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we are not oligarchs with gold watches, we are in no way average. Why? Because average is average. Average is having average ambition. Average is having average intellect. Average is receiving an average education. Average is living in the same town where you grew up, be it rural or urban. Average is average because it is average, and we - my liberal, creative, resilient, radically-capable peers - my entire Facebook feed - by trivial definition, are far from average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;So, while we were busy with prosperity, what was the average American doing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
First and foremost, I hardly know. (This, I now resolutely realize, is a major problem; much more on this below.) However, at peripheral speculation, I'd posit the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average American is in the throes of a rapidly changing world and isn't sure how to react. This is an honest, decent taxi driver who's lost her job to Uber or a factory worker who's lost his job to a machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average American is a judicious high-school graduate without the resources to attend a strong University, and thereafter obtain a well-paying job. Vacation, mobility, and even food security are not promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average American is a nurse with no idea why they are working 20-hour shifts 4 times per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the average American is an honest citizen who expects their government to facilitate a reasonable quality of life, whereby with average work ethic, average ambition and average creativity one can live a healthy, comfortable, average life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, this seems incredibly reasonable. As we know, this is less and less our reality. The last few Presidents have done very little for these people. They are rational, and they wanted something new. That is a simplified explanation as to why a reckless and woefully under-prepared Donald Trump now finds himself in the most powerful office in the world. So, what do we do from here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let's get to know each other&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, it is now brutally apparent that we must get to know the other side. Education is power, right? When we want to solve a problem, we first learn as much as we possibly can about the subject in question. Novelly, however, this process may be particularly and incredibly challenging when the object in question spits at your very existence: am I really meant to dialogue with someone flying a Nazi flag? Here, I'm saying yes. I'd like your thoughts as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bigotry is but a vehicle for blame&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We roil Trump and his base for bigotry, but bigotry is but a vehicle for blame. Blame for what, though? For the problems outlined above - for the increasingly elusive promise of a comfortable life for the typical citizen. Trump was elected because he represented a sidestep from the American politics that have underserved our masses for the last quarter-century. Throughout his campaign, he resonated with those people who had real problems that needed solving, all the while using immigrants and minorities as a scapegoat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, the American government is to largely blame for these problems - for perpetuating serving-to-few policies on wealth distribution, education and healthcare. Furthermore, if these problems didn't exist, I personally doubt that the people that screamed "time to go home, Apu" to a Google engineer in Silicon Valley yesterday would harbor blind hatred towards anyone at all, let alone complete strangers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let's not go crazy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, lawnmowers kill &lt;a href="https://s22.postimg.org/xinxs3q01/Screen_Shot_2016_11_10_at_4_25_16_PM.png"&gt;35 times more people&lt;/a&gt; annually than "Islamic jihadist immigrants;" when I hear fears of the latter, I chuckle in basic rationality and instead fear my chances of crossing a Manhattan Avenue. On the same note, we must realize that the scary individual who spray-painted &lt;a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/clout/400560361.html"&gt;"Sieg Heil 2016"&lt;/a&gt; in downtown Philadelphia on the 78th anniversary of Kristallnacht is an &lt;em&gt;extreme minority&lt;/em&gt;, and while this case and any case of hate and bigotry should be treated extremely seriously, there is not (yet) reason to start running for the hills. Conversely, I would submit that the overwhelming majority of Trump's base is a rational and welcoming human like most of the world, motivated by little more than frustration and basic human selfishness, i.e. wanting the best future for yourself and those you love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crisis brings opportunity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comes from my friend Adrian, and admittedly, I didn't initially understand what he meant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If Hillary had won, we wouldn't be having this conversation: we would have virtually high-five'd each other and moved on with our days. We wouldn't be discussing political involvement. We wouldn't be discussing the problems in this country! We wouldn't be discussing what to do next."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In times of "crisis," people are incredibly willing to taking meetings, take phone calls, hear ideas and share their own. We, liberals, now realize there are real problems in our country that we, capable and creative, can perhaps work to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The majority of the country voted for Hillary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's not forget this. Furthermore, the millennial map was blue, blue and blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Talk is cheap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I frequently discuss geopolitics as a point of hobby. However, I've never involved myself in the political process. Presently, I live in Morocco. Let us remember - for as much as I and we offer our thoughts and ideas - talk is very cheap. None of this matters if we don't actually do something. If we don't build tools for education. If we don't facilitate communication between diverse groups of people. If we don't take time out of our days to actively learn about those that supported and support our to-be President, no matter how gut-wrenchingly challenging that may well be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a point of closure, if you take any issue with this post, please let me know. Please tell me I'm ignorant of American realities. Please tell me I'm willfully blind. This is the point. Educate me and let's educate ourselves. No problem was ever really solved without first deeply understanding the problem itself. I, for one, have a lot of things to learn about half of the country in which I was born.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="life"></category></entry><entry><title>My Open-Source Machine Learning Masters (in Casablanca, Morocco)</title><link href="https://cavaunpeu.github.io/2016/07/29/my-open-source-machine-learning-masters-in-casablanca-morocco/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-29T15:23:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-07-29T15:23:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Will Wolf</name></author><id>tag:cavaunpeu.github.io,2016-07-29:/2016/07/29/my-open-source-machine-learning-masters-in-casablanca-morocco/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A 9-month self-curated deep-dive into select topics in machine learning and distributed computing.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Open-Source Machine Learning Masters (OSMLM) is a self-curated deep-dive into select topics in machine learning and distributed computing. Educational resources are derived from online courses (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course"&gt;MOOCs&lt;/a&gt;), textbooks, predictive modeling competitions, academic research (&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/"&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;), and the open-source software community. In machine learning, both the quantity and quality of these resources - all available for free or at a trivial cost - is truly f*cking amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Am I Doing This?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to become more of a technical expert in machine learning. I want to use this expertise to solve real-world problems that actually matter (moving the field forward on purely theoretical grounds is less interesting to me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end, I see two main roads: a traditional graduate program, and the OSMLM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why Not Graduate School&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, graduate school is suboptimal for 3 key reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's expensive.&lt;/strong&gt; Upon a quick Google search, a 2-year graduate program would cost, conservatively, $80,000 in tuition fees alone. This is a wholly nontrivial sum of money that would impact how I structure the next 10 years of my life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; more dependencies.&lt;/strong&gt; I have to apply. I have to get accepted. I have to find the right professor. I have to find a city suitable to my broader interests and lifestyle. This takes time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the time I finish, the field of machine learning will look fundamentally different than it did when I started.&lt;/strong&gt; This is the most important point of all. The only way to remain current with the latest tools and techniques is to do just that. Given the furious and only-accelerating-faster pace at which machine learning is moving, this requires much more than just a few hours on the weekend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why the OSMLM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think the higher education paradigm is changing.&lt;/strong&gt; Access to critical, academic knowledge is increasingly democratic: &lt;a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/"&gt;Khan Academy&lt;/a&gt; can teach me about the Central Limit Theorem as well as any statistics professor. The ~$250,000 in tuition fees commanded by an undergraduate education at a private American university is, for some, several decades of debt and concession, and for others, prohibitive beyond comedy, reason and fantasy alike. If hard-skills are your end, online self-education is an immensely attractive, intuitive, and practical road to follow - especially in an industry as meritocratic as tech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'm keenly aware of how productive I am in a self-teaching environment.&lt;/strong&gt; I'm largely self-taught in data science. Before that, it was online poker: a 5-year, $50 to $150,000 journey of instructional videos, online forums, critical discussion with other players and personal coaching - all from the comfort of my bedroom. I'm very effective at learning things online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some of the most impactful projects I've completed professionally stemmed directly from those I'd completed personally.&lt;/strong&gt; I would not know how to ensemble models if not for &lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/"&gt;Kaggle&lt;/a&gt;. I would not know how to perform hierarchical Bayesian inference if not for &lt;a href="http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/"&gt;Bayesian Methods for Hackers&lt;/a&gt;. The open-source data science community continues to teach me creative ways to use data to solve challenging problems. To this end, I want to consume, consume, consume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The road to further technical expertise is a function of little more than time and effort.&lt;/strong&gt; I have a few years' industry experience as a Data Scientist. I can write clean code and productionize machine learning things. For me, the OSMLM is nothing more than taking all of the extra-curricular time spent learning new tools and algorithms and making it a full-time job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I'm extremely motivated.&lt;/strong&gt; The thought of studying machine learning all day has me smiling from ear to ear. Simply put, I f*cking love this stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Long is the OSMLM?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9-12 months. Not forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Morocco?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I aim to speak indistinguishably fluent French and Spanish by the time I'm 30. I'm currently 27. The Spanish box is largely &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqO0KW3O9uU"&gt;checked&lt;/a&gt;. With 6-9 months in Francophone Morocco, the French box will be largely checked as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I've always wanted to live in a Muslim country: I grew up in a predominantly Jewish suburb of Philadelphia, and have had fantastic experiences traveling the Muslim world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Will I Spend My Time?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be spending my best 8-10 hours of the day working from a co-working space. I'll be taking online courses, reading textbooks, participating in machine learning competitions and publishing open-source code. I intend to post frequently to this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Will I Learn?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have 4 main areas of focus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Deep Learning" with flavors of: auto-encoders, recommendation, and natural language processing.&lt;/strong&gt; I remain obsessed with encoding real-world entities as lists of numbers. I like applications that seek to understand people better than they understand themselves. Free-form text is everywhere (and relatively quick to process).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bayesian Inference.&lt;/strong&gt; Because they taught me frequentist statistics in school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game Theory and Reinforcement Learning.&lt;/strong&gt; I wrote an &lt;a href="https://honors.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/1947"&gt;undergraduate thesis&lt;/a&gt; in game theory and group dynamics and remain eager to tackle more. Reinforcement Learning seems like the hipster way to solve such problems these days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apache Spark and Distributed Computing.&lt;/strong&gt; I have a bit of professional experience with Spark. As data continues to grow in size, distributed computing will move from a thing Google does to a no-duh occupational necessity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Does Success Look Like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success has a few faces:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical.&lt;/strong&gt; Have the technical expertise to lead teams focused on each of the above 4 topics (weighted towards the former 3, realistically).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal.&lt;/strong&gt; Learning how I best learn. How do I structure my ideal working day? Do I prefer working alone, or indeed as part of a team? What is my optimal balance of reading, thinking, and coding?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language.&lt;/strong&gt; I intend to speak French like it's my mother tongue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Happens Afterwards?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm likely headed back to the Americas, where I intend to devote myself to an impossibly awesome technology project and team for a period of several years. I'd like a technical mentor as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Can You Help?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to self-study, I'd like to assist a few fascinating Moroccan technology organizations with their data problems. As such, if you know anyone in-country with even the most fleeting shared interest, please put me in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In Two Sentences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Open-Source Machine Learning Masters in Casablanca, Morocco allows me to pursue several significant personal goals at the same time. This is my Francophone machine learning adventure.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="life"></category></entry></feed>
